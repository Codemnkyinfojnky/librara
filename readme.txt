Library app project- The Mahagony library:


-This app provides you with a HTML GUI to manage a library.

With this app you will be able to manage basic library functions: handeling customers, books and

keeping check on the books loaned from the library you manage.



-To manage this app properly please take a look at the following guidlines:

when you add a customer or a book the the library data base you will add its or his ID manually.

you may use any number starting from 1.


-When adding a book to the library database you will have to determine the book type:

type 1- 10 days loan time

type 2- 5 days loan time

type 3- 2 days loan time

a book will have only one type from the three types above!

**when adding the type on the browser you will choose from numeral options (1,2,3)


-Book Loaning:

- when you loan a book a loan status will be determined- "available" or "not availabe"

 you can see this information in the books data base (library shelves).
